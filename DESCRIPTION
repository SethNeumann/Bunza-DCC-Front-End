Panelized version of basic DCC Front end, in this case from Geoff Bunza as SMA-37

The basic design used here was first presented for use with the SMA20 series decoders - SMA20 Low Cost 17 Channel DCC Decoders Ver 6.01 with Sound,
Triggered Sound,Stepper,Dual Motor,LED and Servo Control   https://model-railroad-hobbyist.com/node/24316  as an integral part of the decoder hardware. 
It was also used as the hardware platform for the IDEC library described here: SMA35 Interactive DCC Decoders IDEC The Next Generation - Sequencing 
Movement Sound & Lighting v1.08  https://model-railroad-hobbyist.com/node/40940   Here it has been separated for use as a stand-alone board, power 
by 5 Volts DC, usually from the accompanying processor board, like an Arduino. Header pins can be applied with 0.1 inch spacing for the DCC inout 
connection and for the connection to your porcessor/Arduino in DCC-Signal, +5 Volt Power In, and Ground (GND) connection just like a servo or sensor 
would be wired. This has been tried with several boards like the Arduino Uno, Pro Mini, Mega2560, Nano, Micro, Pro Micro, Leonardo, ATTiny167, 
Tinyzero, Teensy3.x and Teensy4.x series.

Similar circuits have been published elsewhere.  My intent is to provide an affordable substrate for those wishing to build stationary DCC Decoders.
